This was my first ever non-script relatively significant programming project ever that I'd started well over a year ago. I made a lot of progress on it and it took very little to make it publishable, but I'd
dropped it out of a newfound lack of motivation. It had been eating away at me for a while so I'm quite proud to finally finish it, despite now being aware that it 
is atrocious code in several aspects, but hindsight is of course 20/20... 
Anyhow it is a python program for playing chess in a terminal
